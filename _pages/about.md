I am a Master's student in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/sites/en_sc/index.do) (South Korea), where I am a member of the [Digital Signal Processing and AI (DSPAI) Lab](http://dsp.yonsei.ac.kr/) advised by Professor Hong-Goo Kang. 
My primary research goal is to bridge the gap between classic signal processing and modern deep learning, with interests spanning `digitial signal processing`, `speech and audio processing`, `audio compression`, and `generative models`.

I am passionate about finding synergies between established algorithms and cutting-edge AI. My first research experience as an undergraduate at the [SRIP Lab](http://srip.yonsei.ac.kr/xe/) involved implementing and analyzing traditional image signal processing algorithms such as `denoising`, `demosaicing`, and `super-resolution`. 
This interest has continued in my graduate studies, where I've explored projects such as guiding the traditional SOLA algorithm with an LLM to achieve context-aware time-scale modification.

My most recent research focuses on developing a side-information-based module for `high-frequency generation` to restore legacy audio codecs, as well as `blind audio super-resolution`. 
I received my B.S. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Yonsei University in 2024 and am expected to complete my M.S. at Yonsei University in 2026.

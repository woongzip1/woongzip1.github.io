  abstract  = {[Spectral band replication (SBR) enables bit-efficient coding by generating high-frequency bands from the low-frequency ones. However, it only utilizes coarse spectral features upon a subband-wise signal replication, limiting adaptability to diverse acoustic signals. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of a deep neural network (DNN)-based generative approach for coding the high-frequency bands, which we call neural spectral band generation (n-SBG). Specifically, we propose a DNN-based encoder-decoder structure to extract and quantize the side information related to the high-frequency components and generate the components given both the side information and the decoded core-band signals. The whole coding pipeline is optimized with generative adversarial criteria to enable the generation of perceptually plausible sound. From experiments using AAC as the core codec, we show that the proposed method achieves a better perceptual quality than HE-AAC-v1 with much less side information.

  abstract  = {[Bandwidth extension (BWE) is a technique that estimates high-frequency components from provided low-frequency components. Most existing deep neural network-based BWE methods rely solely on information from the band-limited audio signal. Drawing inspiration from spectral band replication (SBR), we propose a novel BWE framework that employs self-supervised pre-trained features as conditional inputs in the BWE process. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline SEANet architecture in terms of log-spectral distance (LSD) and PESQ. Additionally, we explore the methodologies for extracting and quantizing self-supervised learning (SSL) features to effectively utilize them as conditional inputs.]},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
